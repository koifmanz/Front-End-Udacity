                <p>One of the most remarkable formations associated with glacial deposits consists of vast sheets of
                    the fine-grained, yellowish, wind-blown material called loess. Somewhat peculiar climatic
                    conditions evidently prevailed when it was formed. At present similar deposits are being laid
                    down only near the leeward margin of great deserts. The famous loess deposits of China in the
                    lee of the Desert of Gobi are examples. During the Pleistocene period, however, loess
                    accumulated in a broad zone along the margin of the ice sheet at its maximum extent. In the Old
                    World it extended from France across Germany and through the Black Earth region of Russia into
                    Siberia. In the New World a still larger area is loess-covered. In the Mississippi Valley, tens
                    of thousands of square miles are mantled by a layer exceeding twenty feet in thickness and in
                    many places approaching a hundred feet. Neither the North American nor the European deposits are
                    associated with a desert. Indeed, loess is lacking in the western and drier parts of the great
                    plains and is best developed in the well-watered states of Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri. Part of
                    the loess overlies the non-glacial materials of the great central plain, but the northern
                    portions overlie the drift deposits of the first three glaciations. A few traces of loess are
                    associated with the Kansan and Illinoian, the second and third glaciations, but most of the
                    American
                    loess appears to have been formed at approximately the time of the Iowan or fourth glaciation,
                    while only a little overlies the drift sheets of the Wisconsin age. The loess is thickest near
                    the margin of the Iowan till sheet and thins progressively both north and south. The thinning
                    southward is abrupt along the stream divides, but very gradual along the larger valleys. Indeed,
                    loess is abundant along the bluffs of the Mississippi, especially the east bluff, almost to the
                    Gulf of Mexico.</p>

            <div class="post-section2">
                <p>It is now generally agreed that all typical loess is wind blown. There is still much question,
                    however, as to its time of origin, and thus indirectly as to its climatic implications. Several
                    American and European students have thought that the loess dates from inter-glacial times. On
                    the other hand, Penck has concluded that the loess was formed shortly before the commencement of
                    the glacial epochs; while many American geologists hold that the loess accumulated while the ice
                    sheets were at approximately their maximum size. W. J. McGee, Chamberlin and Salisbury, Keyes,
                    and others lean toward this view. In this chapter the hypothesis is advanced that it was formed
                    at the one other possible time, namely, immediately following the retreat of the ice.

                    These four hypotheses as to the time of origin of loess imply the following differences in its
                    climatic relations. If loess was formed during typical inter-glacial epochs, or toward the close
                    of such epochs, profound general aridity must seemingly have prevailed in order to kill off the
                    vegetation and thus enable the wind to pick up sufficient dust. If the loess was formed during
                    times of extreme glaciation when the glaciers were supplying large quantities of fine material
                    to outflowing streams, less aridity would be required, but there must have been
                    sharp contrasts between wet seasons in summer when the snow was melting and dry seasons in
                    winter when the storms were forced far south by the glacial high pressure. Alternate floods and
                    droughts would thus affect broad areas along the streams. Hence arises the hypothesis that the
                    wind obtained the loess from the flood plains of streams at times of maximum glaciation. If the
                    loess was formed during the rapid retreat of the ice, alternate summer floods and winter
                    droughts would still prevail, but much material could also be obtained by the winds not only
                    from flood plains, but also from the deposits exposed by the melting of the ice and not yet
                    covered by vegetation.</p>
